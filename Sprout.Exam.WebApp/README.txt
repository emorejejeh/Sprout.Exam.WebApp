If we are going to deploy this on production, what do you think is the next
improvement that you will prioritize next? This can be a feature, a tech debt, or
an architectural design.

1. I think we can improve the validation by using FluentValidation because by using this third party validator,
we can put some logic behind our dto validations.

2. It is safer if we use .Net Core 3.1 than .Net 5 because it is more stable but .Net 5 is more faster
.Net Core 3.1 but stability is more important to me.

3. Lastly, it is nice to have the Integration Tests for us to have more stable system without having so
bugs from end to end process.
